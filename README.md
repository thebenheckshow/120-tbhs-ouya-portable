# 120-tbhs-ouya-portable
Ben has been challenged by many viewers to make the OUYA into a Heck-style portable gaming device. For the first part of the project, Ben mods an LCD and the OUYA to be as thin as possible. After removing any unneeded components, he works to wire up the HDMI and get the screen and OUYA working as one. He'll sketch-up an idea for how the project will come together in the next episode before calling it a day.
